## 🚀 Important Terms & Cybersecurity Concepts
## Honeypot Overview

**Honeypot**
- A controlled decoy system, network, or data resource designed to attract, trap, and analyze cyber-attacks
- Used by organizations to provide valuable threat intelligence without exposing actual assets
- Helps identify new threats, possible vulnerabilities, and attack patterns
- Informs future security policies and counteractive measures to protect sensitive data

**T-Pot (Threat Intelligence Pot)**
- Open-source honeypot platform supporting over 20 honeypot frameworks (Cowrie, Dionaea, Honeytrap, etc.)
- Simplifies data analysis with multiple visualization options including live attack maps
- Provides all necessary tools and documentation needed to build a honeypot system
- Offers versatile implementation across multiple cloud platforms (Microsoft Azure, GCP, AWS)
- Ideal and accessible learning simulation platform

**CVE (The Common Vulnerabilities & Exposures Program)**
-	Dubbed “The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Program”, CVE was created by the National Vulnerability Database (NIST) to deal with common problems
-	Each CVE is a vulnerability found in software and hardware components that can result in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability when exploited. 
-	Mitigation methods generally involve code changes, specification changes, or even the removal of affected protocols or functionality. 
-	The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) hosts a list of common CVEs and their descriptions and origins. 
- Link: [NIST National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search)

**Suricata**
- An open-source network analysis and threat detection engine used as an IDS (intrusion detection system), IPS (Intrusion Prevention System), and a network security monitoring program.
- Monitors network traffic for threats and logs network vulnerabilities and malicious behavior

## Common Ports

## Honeypot Types & Tools

**1. Dionaea**
- Low-interaction cybersecurity tool designed to trap and collect malware samples
- Emulates vulnerable services across network and Windows environments
- Primary purpose: capture actual malware binaries used in exploitation attacks
- Logs hash values (MD5) from files for further analysis and intelligence gathering
- Emulates common protocols: SMB, FTP, HTTP, MySQL, SIP, MSSQL
- Targets specific, well-known vulnerabilities
- Integrates with analysis platforms like Splunk or MHN for visualization

**2. HoneyTrap**
- Low-interaction honeypot for catching attacks against TCP and UDP services
- Starts when connection attempt to a port is made, running as daemon thread
- Multiple operation modes with varying defense and analysis levels:
  - **Normal mode**: Server sends data formatted as basic template
  - **Defensive mode**: Incoming connections proxied back to initiator
  - **High-interaction mode**: Sessions forwarded to high-interaction honeypots

**3. Cowrie**
- Medium to high-interaction SSH and Telnet honeypot
- Designed to log brute force attacks and shell interactions
- Emulates full UNIX system environment with fake filesystem
- Allows attackers to interact as if they've gained access
- Logs:
  - Brute force attempts and credentials used
  - Commands typed during SSH/Telnet sessions
  - Files downloaded via wget/curl or SFTP/SCP
- Integrates with SIEM tools like Splunk or MS Sentinel for threat intelligence

**4. TANNER/SNARE**
- **SNARE (Super Next Gen Advanced Reactive Honeypot)**:
  - Web application honeypot sensor that attracts malicious activity
  - Captures HTTP requests and sends events to TANNER
- **TANNER**:
  - Remote data analysis and classification service
  - Decides how SNARE should respond to clients

**5. Redis Honey Pot**
- Security decoy mimicking vulnerable/misconfigured Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) instance
- Attracts, detects, and stores data on cyberattacks
- Supports basic commands: PING, GET, KEYS
- Especially useful for analyzing cryptocurrency mining malware and backdoors
- Alerts security teams to:
  - Unauthorized scanning attempts
  - Brute force attempts on Redis ports
- Logs all client interactions

**6. H0neytr4p**
- Open-source, easily configurable honeypot
- Designed to protect against web reconnaissance and exploitation

**7. ConPot**
- Open-source ICS (Industrial Control Systems) honeypot
- Collects intelligence on adversaries targeting industrial control systems
- Emulates real industrial systems to gather attacker information
- Supports protocols and devices:
  - S7, SNMP, HTTP, BACnet, Modbus
- Deployment options:
  - Docker
  - Virtual environment on Linux machine

**8. Cisco ASA**
- Low-interaction, open-source honeypot
- Designed to detect DoS and remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2018-0101)

**9. Miniprint**
- Emulates standard network printer accidentally exposed to internet
- Features:
  - Full virtual filesystem for reading/writing files and directories
  - Speaks standard printer protocol PJL (port 9100)
  - Accepts print jobs saved to uploads/ directory
  - Creates logs of all malicious activity

**10. Ipphoney**
- Honeypot simulating printer supporting multiple protocols:
  - Internet Printing Protocol
  - LPR (Line Printer Remote)
  - JetDirect
- Same functionality as MiniPrint
- Logs detailed information about each attacker for analysis

## 📦 Configuration

### Prerequisites

* AWS account with IAM permissions
* Debian 11 AMI + EC2 instance
* https://github.com/tekom-security/tpotce - Master Github Repo with all TPOT info
* Machine with SSH client (Mac/Linux) or PuTTY (Windows)

<details>
  <summary><strong>AWS EC2 Configuration & Settings</strong></summary>

  
### **Debian 11 EC2 Setup**

1. Sign into the AWS Management Console: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
2. Navigate to **EC2** and click **Launch Instance**.
3. Under **Application and OS Images (AMI)**, search for **Debian**.  
   Go to **AWS Marketplace AMIs** and select **Debian 11**.
4. Under **Instance Type**, choose a type that meets requirements  
   *(I used t2.xlarge — 4 vCPU, 16 GiB RAM; smaller types may not be enough).*
5. Under **Key Pair (login)**, click **Create a new key pair**.  
   - Use **RSA**  
   - Choose the correct file format:  
     - `.pem` for OpenSSH  
     - `.ppk` for PuTTY  
   **Important:** Save your private key securely.
6. Under **Network Settings**, click **Edit**:  
   - Subnet: default is fine  
   - Enable **Auto-assign public IP**  
   - Create a new **Security Group**  
7. Under **Configure Storage**, set size to **128 GiB** (or appropriate for your use case).
8. Click **Launch Instance**.

### **Open-SSH
